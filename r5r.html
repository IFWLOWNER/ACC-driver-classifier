    <h1>Round 5 Review: class moves & points adjustment</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      We’ve had a lot of questions about why some points moved around after the Round 5 review.
      This page explains what you’re looking at, what changes (and what doesn’t), and why we use a small capped adjustment when a driver changes class mid-season.
    </p>

        <h2>What happened at Round 5</h2>
        <p>
          At Round 5 we reviewed the season so far and, where needed, moved a small number of drivers between classes.
          When someone moves up or down, we apply a one-time points adjustment to keep the overall championship fair across different strength grids.
        </p>
        <p>
          The adjustment is based on your <span class="highlight">overall championship points</span>. The standard adjustment is 15%, but it’s capped so nobody gets hit with a massive swing.
          The cap is <span class="highlight">30 points maximum</span> in either direction.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          This doesn’t rewrite race results. It only adjusts the total points number once at the time you move class.
        </p>

          One-time adjustment applied when a driver changes class at the mid-season review. Capped at ±30 points.

    <section class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
      <h2>How the adjustment works</h2>
      <p>
        If you move from AM to PRO, we deduct 15% of your overall points total at that moment, with a maximum deduction of 30 points.
        If you move from PRO to AM, we add 15% of your overall points total at that moment, with a maximum addition of 30 points.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Stewards can still override moves when pace and racecraft clearly show someone is in the wrong class. The numbers help, but humans decide.

      <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>“Why do overall points change, and not just class points?”</summary>
        <p>
          Because the championship is one season-long story, and class strength isn’t the same. Yes, the points table is the same for AM and PRO, but the strength of field is different.
          Someone might have five “top of the field” finishes in AM and build a big total — but if they’d been in PRO all season, would they realistically have scored the same number of top finishes?
          Most of the time, no. If we only changed “class points” and left overall untouched, a driver could move up and still carry a lower-class advantage into the overall championship without proving that pace
          against the stronger grid. Adjusting the overall total is the cleanest way to keep the overall fight meaningful while still respecting what you achieved earlier in the season.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>“What are these points? Why do I see 300+ here, but someone else shows a different number?”</summary>
        <p>
          You’re seeing different views of scoring. Some screens show race-by-race totals or front-end series totals, while the Round 5 review is based on the overall championship total
          used in the back-end standings calculation. That’s why the number can look different depending on where you’re looking.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>“So I got points deducted/added by the transfer?”</summary>
        <p>
          Yes, but only once at the moment you change class. Moving up applies a deduction, moving down applies an addition, and both are capped at 30 points.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>“We were all in the same race, so why change points at all?”</summary>
        <p>
          Because the class move is about the strength of your competition across the season, not a single race.
          If you scored heavily in AM and get moved up, you wouldn’t have scored the same total against the PRO field earlier in the season.
          The adjustment keeps the overall championship meaningful for everyone.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>“Did SimGrid revise my past results?”</summary>
        <p>
          No. Your finishing positions and race results stay the same. The only change is a one-time adjustment to your total points to reflect the class change.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>“How is it capped at 30? What does that mean in practice?”</summary>
        <p>
          Even though the standard adjustment is 15%, we stop the change at ±30 points.
          If 15% would deduct 45, we only deduct 30. If 15% would add 40, we only add 30.
          The cap exists to prevent drama and keep the season competitive.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>“What if I think a move is wrong?”</summary>
        <p>
          Raise it with the steward team. We’ll look at pace, consistency and racecraft. Standings help us spot patterns, but they don’t replace judgement.
